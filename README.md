# SAT Tutor Chatbot
## What is it?
### An AI chatbot that is meant to help tutor students on the SAT. It is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I designed the chatbot specifically to help tutor students with the SAT, and not answer unrelated questions. 
## How can I use it?
### Use pip install flask openai to install the dependencies for the chatbot, and run export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key" and py3 app.py for windows or python3 app.py for mac. Make sure to replace "your-api-key" with your actual API Key.
