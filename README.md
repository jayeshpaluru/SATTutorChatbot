# SAT Tutor Chatbot
## What is it?
### An AI chatbot that is meant to help tutor students on the SAT. It is built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I designed the chatbot specifically to help tutor students with the SAT, and not answer unrelated questions. 
## How can I use it?
### Use pip install flask openai to install the dependencies for the chatbot, and run py3 app.py for windows or python3 app.py for mac in the terminal. Make sure to replace "your-api-key" with your actual API Key.
